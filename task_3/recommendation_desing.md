# On-Page Recommendation System Design

## The Problem

On every product page, we must surface 3–5 “Customers also bought/viewed” items/products to boost the upsell.

## Solution Space Categorization

The solution space for designing this recommendation system can be categorized based on the primary data source and underlying methodology, considering both anonymous and logged-in user contexts.

### Solution 1: Item-to-Item Associations (Co-occurrence Based Recommendations)

* **Description:** This solution focuses on identifying products that are frequently purchased or viewed together in historical customer interactions. It establishes fundamental relationships between products based on collective user behavior.

* **Data Sources:**

    * **Transaction Logs:** Records of all purchases, detailing which user bought which products in a single transaction (for "bought together").

    * **Session Logs:** Records of user browse activity, detailing the sequence of products viewed within a single session (for "viewed together").

* **Pros:**

    * **High Relevance:** Often yields highly relevant recommendations because they are based on actual collective user behavior.

    * **No Explicit User Profiles/Item Features Needed:** Can work purely on interaction data (though enriched data improves it).

    * **Relatively Simple to Implement (Basic):** Simple co-occurrence counting is straightforward.

    * **Low Online Computational Cost:** Recommendations can be pre-computed offline and served via simple lookups.

* **Cons:**

    * **Cold Start Problem (New Items):** Cannot recommend new products until they have accumulated sufficient interaction data.

    * **Sparsity Problem (Long Tail):** Less popular items may not have enough co-occurrence data to generate meaningful recommendations.

    * **Lack of Diversity:** Can sometimes recommend items that are too similar or from the same obvious categories, limiting discovery.

    * **Scalability for Deep Associations:** Computing higher-order associations (e.g., items bought with items that were bought with X) can become computationally expensive.

    * **Computational Cost (Offline):** Calculating all pairwise or transactional associations can be resource-intensive for very large item catalogs and transaction histories, but typically manageable for e-commerce scales.

* **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **Data Collection:** Implement logging for all product purchases and browsing sessions.

    2.  **Offline Processing:** Periodically (e.g., daily) process transaction and session logs to build a co-occurrence matrix (or graph) of items.

    3.  **Pre-computation:** For each product, identify and store its top N co-occurring products (e.g., in a key-value store or database table).

    4.  **Online Serving:** When a product page is loaded, retrieve the pre-computed recommendations for that product ID via a simple database lookup.

### Solution 2: Content-Based Recommendations

* **Description:** This solution recommends items that are inherently similar to the currently viewed product based on their intrinsic attributes and characteristics. It is crucial for handling new products (cold start) and ensuring semantic relevance when behavioral data is sparse.

* **Data Sources:**

    * **Product Catalog/Database:** Detailed information about each product, including:

        * Product Name & Description

        * Category & Sub-category

        * Brand

        * Attributes (e.g., color, material, size, technical specifications)

        * Price

* **Pros:**

    * **Handles Cold Start (New Items):** Can recommend new products immediately as long as their attributes are defined.

    * **Explainability:** Recommendations are often easy to explain (e.g., "because it's also a blue cotton t-shirt").

    * **Diversity (Controlled):** Can be designed to recommend items across different relevant attributes, aiding discovery.

    * **No User Interaction Data Needed:** Can generate recommendations even without any purchase or view history.

    * **Relatively Low Online Computational Cost:** Similar to Solution 1, recommendations can be pre-computed offline.

* **Cons:**

    * **Requires Rich, Structured Data:** Performance heavily relies on the quality, completeness, and richness of product attributes. Poor data leads to poor recommendations.

    * **Limited to Explicit Features:** May miss subtle relationships between products that are only apparent from user behavior (e.g., people who buy expensive cameras also buy specific camera bags, even if the bags aren't "similar" in content).

    * **Over-specialization:** Can sometimes recommend items that are *too* similar to the viewed product, limiting opportunities for upsell or cross-sell to truly complementary items.

    * **Computational Cost (Offline):** Calculating similarity scores for all pairs of items can be computationally intensive for large catalogs, especially with complex textual features (e.g., deep learning embeddings of descriptions).

* **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **Data Preparation:** Extract and standardize relevant attributes from your product catalog. For textual descriptions, consider text processing (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings).

    2.  **Offline Processing:** Define a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity, Jaccard index) and compute pairwise similarity scores between all products.

    3.  **Pre-computation:** For each product, identify and store its top N most similar products based on content.

    4.  **Online Serving:** When a product page is loaded, retrieve the pre-computed content-based recommendations for that product ID.

### Solution 3: Personalized Recommendation

* **Description:** If we are dealing with a logged-in user, this solution involves filtering, re-ranking, or generating entirely personalized scores for candidate recommendations based on individual user preferences and real-time context.

* **Methods**

    * **User-User Collaborative Filtering:**

        * **Description:** Identifies users with similar past interaction patterns (e.g., users who have bought/viewed similar products). Once similar users are found, items that those similar users have interacted positively with (and that the current user hasn't yet seen or bought) can be recommended. This can be used to refine the ranking of candidate items: if users similar to the current one also tend to buy a specific recommended item, it gets a boost.

    * **Filtering & Re-ranking based on User History:** Explicitly exclude purchased/recently viewed items, and re-order based on a user's past brand/category/price preferences.

    * **Matrix Factorization / User-Item Embeddings:** Learn representations for both users and items to predict personalized relevance scores for candidate recommendations. This could be integrated into the scoring function for the candidates.

    * **Deep Learning:** More complex neural networks to capture non-linear user-item interactions and contextual signals for highly personalized recommendations. For example, we can use a Transformer, where the inputs are user and product embeddings and the output is a score predicting the probability of that user buys the product.

    * **Contextual Signals:** Incorporates real-time environmental and situational factors to dynamically adjust recommendations. This can apply to both anonymous and logged-in users. Examples include time-of-day, day-of-week, geographic location, weather, device type, referrer, or current session's immediate intent (e.g., items in cart, recent search queries).

* **Data Sources:**

    * **User Purchase History:** Detailed records of all products a specific logged-in user has bought.

    * **User Viewing History:** Detailed records of all products a specific logged-in user has viewed (both recent session and long-term history).

    * **User Explicit Feedback (Optional):** Ratings, likes/dislikes, wishlists, saved items.

    * **User Demographics (Optional & Permissible):** Age, gender, location (use with caution and ensure privacy compliance).

    * **Current Session Data:** Real-time information about the user's current browse session, including items in their shopping cart, recent search queries, and time spent on pages.

    * **Real-time Contextual Data:**

        * **Geolocation Data:** User's current location (e.g., IP address based, browser permissions).

        * **Timestamp:** Time of day, day of week, season.

        * **Device Information:** Type of device (mobile, desktop, tablet).

        * **Environmental Data:** External APIs for weather, events (e.g., local holidays, sports events).

        * **Current Session State:** Items currently in cart, recent search queries, referring URL.

* **Pros:**

    * **Highly Personalized:** Provides the most relevant recommendations to individual logged-in users, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

    * **Addresses Cold Start (New Users - to some extent):** While user-user collaborative filtering has a user cold-start problem, hybrid models can use content-based or item-item recommendations as a fallback for new users.

    * **Captures Nuance:** Can discover more complex and subtle patterns in user preferences that simple co-occurrence or content methods might miss.

    * **Improved Diversity (with proper tuning):** Can be designed to balance relevance with diversity, preventing over-specialization.

* **Cons:**

    * **Computational Cost (High):**

        * **Offline:** Training complex models (Matrix Factorization, Neural Networks, GNNs) can be very computationally expensive and time-consuming, requiring significant GPU/CPU resources. User-User collaborative filtering can also be expensive for a large number of users.

        * **Online:** While many parts are pre-computed, real-time filtering, re-ranking, and predicting with complex models for each user-item pair can still add latency.

    * **Data Sparsity (User Cold Start):** New users or infrequent users will have very little history, making it difficult to build accurate personal profiles or find similar users.

    * **Complexity:** Requires significant expertise in machine learning, data engineering, and MLOps to implement, maintain, and scale.

    * **Explainability (Lower):** Complex models can be "black boxes," making it harder to explain *why* a particular recommendation was made to a user.

    * **Privacy Concerns:** Handling and utilizing sensitive user data requires careful consideration of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

* **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **User Data Collection:** Collect and store comprehensive user interaction history (purchases, views, clicks, ratings) and relevant contextual data (device, time, location if available).

    2.  **Offline Model Training:** Train a personalized recommendation model (e.g., Matrix Factorization, Deep Learning model) using the collected user and item data. This model learns user and item embeddings or direct prediction functions.

    3.  **Real-time Personalization Logic:** When a logged-in user views a product page:

        * Retrieve candidate recommendations (e.g., from Solution 1 or 2).

        * Fetch the user's current context and historical profile.

        * Apply filtering rules (e.g., exclude already purchased items).

        * Use the trained model to re-rank the candidates based on the user's personalized score for each item.

        * Select the top N personalized recommendations.

### Solution 4: Hybrid Approach

* **Description:** A hybrid approach combines elements from two or more of the above solutions (Item-to-Item Associations, Content-Based, and Personalized Recommendations) to leverage their individual strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. For instance, it might use Item-to-Item associations for the primary candidate generation, fall back to Content-Based for cold-start items, and then apply Personalized Recommendation techniques (like filtering by user history or re-ranking with user embeddings) to refine the final list for logged-in users. This often leads to the most robust and effective real-world recommendation systems.

* **Data Sources:** All data sources from Solutions 1, 2, and 3, as appropriate for the chosen hybrid strategy.

* **Pros:**

    * **Robustness:** Combines the strengths of different approaches, leading to more reliable recommendations across various scenarios (e.g., handles cold start better than pure collaborative filtering).

    * **Improved Accuracy & Relevance:** Often outperforms individual methods by leveraging multiple signals.

    * **Flexibility:** Can be tailored to prioritize specific goals (e.g., relevance, diversity, upsell) and adapt to data availability.

* **Cons:**

    * **Increased Complexity:** Design, implementation, and maintenance are more complex than single-solution approaches.

    * **Tuning Challenges:** Requires careful tuning of how different models are combined (e.g., weighting scores, fallback logic).

    * **Higher Overall Computational Cost:** Involves running and combining multiple models, increasing both offline training and potentially online serving costs compared to simpler methods.

* **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **Candidate Generation:** Implement Solution 1 and/or Solution 2 to generate a diverse pool of candidate recommendations for each product (offline).

    2.  **Personalization Layer:** Implement Solution 3's logic to refine and re-rank these candidates based on logged-in user data and real-time context (online).

    3.  **Fusion/Fallback Strategy:** Define rules or a meta-model to combine scores from different approaches or to use one as a fallback for another (e.g., if Item-to-Item yields too few results, use Content-Based).

    4.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Set up an A/B testing infrastructure to continuously evaluate different hybrid strategies and tune parameters based on live user engagement and conversion metrics.

**Explanation of Scores:**

* **Relevance/Accuracy:** Item-to-Item is inherently relevant due to direct behavioral links. Content-Based is relevant semantically but might miss behavioral nuance. Personalized Rec. aims for the highest relevance by tailoring to the individual. Hybrid leverages the best of all for top accuracy.

* **Diversity:** Item-to-Item can be narrow. Content-Based can be controlled for diversity. Personalized Rec. can balance diversity with relevance if designed well. Hybrid offers the most control.

* **Novelty/Discovery:** Item-to-Item often recommends popular co-occurring items. Content-Based can introduce new but similar items. Personalized Rec. might stick to known preferences. Hybrid can balance known preferences with exploration.

* **Item Cold Start Handling:** Item-to-Item struggles. Content-Based excels. Personalized Rec. (especially user-based parts) struggles if new items have no user interactions. Hybrid uses content-based as a strong fallback.

* **User Cold Start Handling:** Item-to-Item and Content-Based are item-centric, so this KPI doesn't directly apply to their core function. Personalized Rec. (user-based CF, user embeddings) struggles with new users. Hybrid can use non-personalized methods for new users.

* **Offline Computational Cost:** Increases with complexity, from simple co-occurrence to deep learning models.

* **Online Computational Cost:** Simple lookups are low. Personalized Rec. involves real-time filtering, re-ranking, or prediction, increasing latency. Hybrid balances pre-computation with online refinement.

* **Explainability:** Simpler models (co-occurrence, content) are easy to explain. Complex ML models are harder to interpret.

* **Implementation Complexity:** Directly correlates with the sophistication of the methods involved.

* **Scalability:** How well the solution handles increasing users, items, and interactions. Simpler methods scale well horizontally. Complex models require more sophisticated infrastructure and MLOps.
